Hi all,

This is Anand , I have about 5 plus years of experience in the IT industry, started my journey as a splunk developer in 2016 , moved to 
Capgemini NA in 2018 , was introduced to application development in Java for about 1.5 years hence, then moved to world of SRE and cloud native apps 
during late 2019.
All through my journey the emphasis was on some form of monitoring or the other. In my first project via JMeter for Load testing, then it was testing automation via cucumber and tracing logs via splunk. My subsequent projects involved creating a single pane of view via Splunk Cloud. 
For me personally it is both a challenge plus some sorrow knowing that ABN Amro is moving away from splunk :).
